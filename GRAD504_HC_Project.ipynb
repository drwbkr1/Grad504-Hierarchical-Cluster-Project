        "HDB uses a K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to calculate core distances between datapoints. Lower numbers represent higher density. It receives two hyperparameters to calculate this number:\n",
        "- min_samples= k\n",
        "- metric= 'distance metric'\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if min_samples= 5, the core distance would equal the metric distance from the 5th nearest neighbor.\n",
        "## 2. Calculate Mutual Reachability Distance\n",
        "MRD is the buffer that allows the MST to reduce computations; it's going to widen the distance between points based on the size of the core distance. Essentially, for any distance between any two points, if either of them has a higher core value, that will replace their distance. This acts as a weight that \"pushes\" outliers further away, reducing the chaining that might occur in the MST.\n",
        "\n",
        "HDBSCAN equates the MRD using the formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "MRD(i,j)=max{core(i), core(j), d(i,j)}.\n",
        "## 3. Build Minimim Spanning Tree\n",
        "This is the bread and butter of HDBSCAN. A minimum spanning tree begins with each point as its own tree---Agglomerative. Then, it iteratively merges points based on sorted MRDs, beginning with the lowest---Single Linkage. As points merge and the MST reaches larger and larger MRDs we see increasingly bigger groups of points merging. This continues until all points are connected in one tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is important because it eliminates the (n^2) calculations that would otherwise occur when determining clusters. Because the MST avoids cyclical edges, calculations are much closer to (n log n).\n",
        "\n",
        "This step of HDBSCAN utilizes either [Prim's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm) or [Baruvka's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bor%C5%AFvka%27s_algorithm) algorithm to assign edges. These are responsible for increasing speed within HDBSCAN. They are applied automatically using the hyperparameter:\n",

        "where 'best' chooses the ideal method depending on distance metrics and dimensionality.\n",

        "## 4. Sweep Thresholds\n",
        "After building the MST, HDBSCAN sweeps the entire tree for event lamdas. These represent the moment where two points (or groups of points) merge. each threshold is detemined as such:\n",
        "\n",
        "λ(e)​=1/MRD(e)\n",
        "\n",

HDBSCAN allows us to condense our MST using the parameter 'min_cluster_size' so when we set it to 1000, our tree only includes groups that would include this size. The resto of those points become noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. Select Clusters\n",

First, we calculate the stabilities of parent and children clusters. we do this by subtracting the event lambda where the children clusters birthed from the event lambda where the clusters split. We take this difference and multiply it by the number of points within the cluster.\n",

There's some interesting differences to see when applying euclidean compared to jaccard, where the former is actually grouping the clusters in ways that would make sense to a human brain. Obviously the rubric says no euclidean, so I'm also interested in cosine. However, I'm not sure why I'm finding resistance to implementing it into HDBSCAN (the unique library). Im considering two options:\n",

        "When I think more about euclidean, I when through some phases. At the beginningI looked at it and the clusters resembled actual regions in the united states. Cool. but then I remembered to take a step back from the 2D space of a map and look at the clusters like I would with Jaccard. Sure, it might include several more flowers in those tighter regions, but it's also going to include positions well outside of those regions. What does that do to the cluster field? I think in general we start to see clusters with more outliers and less tight borders. Is that what we want?\n",
        "\n",

        "One thing I think about is what information do we ascertain from the clusters. In Jaccard, do we actually get a tight cluster of flowers in an area, or do we just get the grouping of flowers that are found in several areas? Do we really know from the cluster what flowers are where if the cluster just includes all the flowers located everywhere? Same goes with the micro clusters. Do they tell us anything about the data if they only include data from one state?\n",
        "\n",
        "I considered the split of flowers in clusters and in noise. This is more arbitrary than it feels because they're still technically in a cluster, just not in the clusters we've defined. If we altered the cluster miniimum to include less points, we might see a lot more clusters and much less noise. So they still exist in a hierarchy although in this plane they aren't being represented."

And then take it even further and place it next to CA/OR/ID which might be totally out there. Right? Because then we have to say \"well how close are all these OR/ID flowers and how about these OR/ID/MO flowers?\"\n",
